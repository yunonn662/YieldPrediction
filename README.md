# YieldPrediction
- This project was part of a group assignment for the course WIH2001 Data Analytics in University of Malaya.
- The project aimed to address SDG12 "Responsible Consumption and Production" where research was on the food lost at pre-retail stages (e.g. agricultural production and harvest stage, post-harvest stage and processing and packaging stage).

## Why Crop Yied Prediction?
1. Market Alignment
   - Farmers can utilize the predicted yield information to adjust their production levels based on market conditions and consumer needs. By avoiding significant mismatches between supply and demand, overproduction can be minimized, reducing the likelihood of surplus crops going to waste.

2. Improved Inventory Management
   - By having a reliable estimate of crop yields, farmers can determine appropriate storage capacities and avoid overstocking.This prevents spoilage or deterioration of excess crops and reduces the chances of them being wasted due to inadequate storage facilities or improper inventory management.

3. Decision Support for Harvest Timing
   - Assist farmers in determining the optimal timing for harvest.This helps ensure that crops are harvested at their peak quality, reducing the likelihood of spoilage or deterioration and minimizing post-harvest food loss.

4. Donation and Redistribution
   - Crop yield predictions can aid in identifying potential surpluses or shortfalls in specific regions.This information can facilitate targeted efforts for food donation, redistribution, or surplus utilization, ensuring that excess food reaches those in need instead of going to waste.
  
## Source of Datasets
1. 'yield(1990-2021).csv' and 'pesticides(1990-2020).csv' was obtained from [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations(FAO)](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QCL).
2. 'rainfall(1981-2022).csv' was obtained from U.S State of Department by using the [Large Scale International Boundaries (LSIB) dataset](https://geonode.state.gov/layers/catalog:geonode:LSIB) and extract rainfall data through **Google Earth Engine** where 'Rainfall Data Script.txt' was used.
3. 'temp(1743-2020.csv' was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/josepferrersnchez/bearkley-earth-surface-temperature-data) where its original source was Berkeley Earth.
